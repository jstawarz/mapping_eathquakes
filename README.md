# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of Project

In this project, we are working with Basil and Sadhana at the Disaster Reporting Network. Using Javascript and GeoJSON data, we will create an 
interactive world map that displays the earthquakes that have occured across the globe over the past seven days. The map will not only show the 
location of the earthquakes, but will be color and sized coded so that the magnitude of the earthquake is visually apparent. Lastly, the map will 
also show the location of the tectonic plates, to further illustrate the relationship between earthquake frequency and severity with relation to the
fault lines. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project will be to visually show the locations of earthquakes over the past seven days, as well as the differences in the
magnitudes of the earthquakes. 


The final maps for this project can be seen below.
